        "He stared up at what was left of his apartment, in a suburb of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. His windows had disappeared, his balcony was on the verge of collapse.Below, personal belongings were strewn across the pathways. Bedsheets and towels hung from the branches of trees.A cruise missile slammed into this ordinary residential block in the Solomianskyi neighbourhood in the early hours of Tuesday morning, likely travelling at about 500mph. The blast destroyed 35 apartments and hollowed out an entire section of the building.",

        "SMRs, sometimes called mini nukes, work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity.Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles.SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor.",
